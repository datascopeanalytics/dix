>Call me Ishmael. Dix is a utility for quantifying large amounts of plaintext data using everyone's favorite metric: Moby Dicks.

Motivation
----------
Have you ever found yourself analyzing text data and thinking, "Wow, this data is **BIG**. This is some **BIG DATA**"?

Of course you have. And if you're like us, you're frustrated with the current tools and metrics at your disposal. How do you quantify how **big** your data is? Bits and bytes and word counts just don't cut it in the fast moving Data Age.

It's time for a new standard. One that's timeless, yet fully capable of expressing **big**ness. That's why we created `dix`.


About
-----
`dix` is a command line utility that quantifies the size of plaintext data in relation to Herman Melville's classic novel [*Moby-Dick; or, The Whale*](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2701/2701-h/2701-h.htm), first published in 1851 and considered to be one of the Great American Novels.
